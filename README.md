Implement a stereo vision based approach to detect obstacles, and an acoustic warning system.
The objectives of the project can be subdivided as:
1. Obstacle detection
2. Localization of obstacles
3. Warning system

Further details and documents of the project can be found in the reports folder.

PS: Special thanks to Daniel Lee for Python package [stereovision](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/StereoVision/1.0.1)
A lot of modification has to be done to accomodate our needs and also OpenCV 3 compatibility, but served as great source of inspiration and help.
